## Overview

**Gadgetory** is a full-stack e-commerce application built with **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS**.  
It provides a seamless shopping experience for customers and a powerful dashboard for admins.  
The platform is hosted on **AWS EC2** and integrated with **Razorpay** for secure payments.

## Key Features

- **User Features**
  - Profile management (details, addresses, order history).
  - Cart with stock-based quantity control.
  - Checkout with COD and Razorpay (restricted COD above ₹1000).
  - Order cancellation and status tracking.
  - Invoice download in PDF format.
  - Continue payments for failed transactions.

- **Admin Features**
  - Dashboard with sales charts (filterable by year/month).
  - Best-selling products, categories, and brands.
  - Order management (update/cancel status).
  - Inventory/stock management.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js + Express**: Backend framework.
- **MongoDB**: Database for users, products, orders.
- **EJS**: Template engine for dynamic views.
- **AWS EC2 + Nginx**: Deployment and hosting.
- **Razorpay**: Payment gateway integration.
- **Multer**: Image upload handling.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Implemented **secure payment handling** with Razorpay and custom error states for failed payments.  
- Designed a **scalable database schema** for products, users, and orders.  
- Learned **AWS deployment and Nginx configuration**, handling issues like SSL, domain setup, and server conflicts.  
- Balancing **user and admin requirements** in a single codebase was a key challenge, solved through modular routing and clean separation of logic.

## Outcome

Gadgetory is a **production-ready e-commerce platform** that demonstrates my ability to build scalable, real-world applications.  
It covers both **technical depth** (server, database, deployment) and **user experience** (checkout flow, admin insights).  
This project is actively hosted on AWS and forms a cornerstone of my portfolio.
